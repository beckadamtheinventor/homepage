Never too Big to Fail - June 4th 2024
A company is never "too big to fail". When Monsanto went under, it went relatively unnoticed; and Monsanto was the biggest agriculture conglomerate in North America!
As such, large companies should be as responsible for their own failiures and held to the same standards -- or higher -- comparative to small businesses.
If a small business is forced to close by lack of funds, why do we not hold larger corporations as accountable?

Additionally, "corporate entities" as stands are held accountable independently of their leadership. While this was originally a good idea, times have changed and corporate leadership is often defacto allowed to commit as many crimes as they want, so long as the profit exceeds the penalty.

Corporate criminals should be held just as accountable as anyone else.
If anything more accountable due to the responsibility that is integral to running a large business.
