Sabotage of Democracy - June 4th 2024
Democracy in North America is being sabotaged by its own leadership.
We must not allow this to continue. As citizens of a democratic country, we are entitled to -- and obligated to ensure -- that we continue live in a democracy.
This means that government officials need to be held responsible too for the crimes they commit.
The only meaningful way to perform this task in the modern age is via peaceful protest; anything remotely violent will be weaponized by those in opposition of the protest.
