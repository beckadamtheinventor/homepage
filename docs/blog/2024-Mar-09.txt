Consciousness - March 9th, 2024
Today I thought of a way to suggest whether a living
entity possessed consciousness.
If there is a way to make the entity "deep sleep" or "turn off", then wake it.
If the entity is conscious, when it awakes it will be aware that is has been "turned off" and will exhibit some form of panic or fear response regardless of the safety of its surroundings.
Otherwise, it should act as if nothing had changed.
